## PentahoTransparentAuthentication

Pentaho Transparent Authentication is a plugin for Pentaho BA Server that provides the platform with additional authentication and login capabilities, in the form of a spring security filter and a bunch of support classes. The goal of this project is to provide a transparent authentication and autologin mechanism, to let users switch between an external web application and Pentaho in an â€œSingle Sign On" fashion.
